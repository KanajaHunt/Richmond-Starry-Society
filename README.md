# Richmond's Starry Society

A Simple APOD App built using NASA's API integration that displays a picture/video for that current day, as well as a description.

# How It's Made

- Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA API

- HTML gave a succinct framework for the text used. Though very standard and basic, the CSS used, efficiently portrayed the basic aesthetic of the app, while the JS portion handled the Fetch and NASA API database.

# Optimizations 

- As I become more comfortable with various software, looking back I would probably use React in tandem with JavaScript by using the `.fetch()` method and integrating the `.setState()` method in React to build dynamic web apps that communicate with APIs and display real-time data to users.
